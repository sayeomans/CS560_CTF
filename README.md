# CS560_CTF
#This is my CTF Project. I used 'docker build -f /home/kali/Documents/CTFAttempt/Dockerfile .' to build my container, since I had problems transfering the files.
#Its a dynamic container, since I encourage people to build their own bash scrips for Problems 1 and 3.
#If you have any trouble building it, please let me know.
