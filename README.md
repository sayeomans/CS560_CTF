# CS560_CTF
#This is my CTF Project. I used 'docker build -f /home/kali/Documents/CTFAttempt/Dockerfile .' to build my container, since I had problems transfering the files.~~<br>
#I then used 'docker run -dit' to build it. You should be able to ssh into it using labuser:labuser. <br>
#Its a dynamic container, since I encourage people to build their own bash scrips for Problems 1 and 3. <br>
#If you have any trouble building it, please let me know.<br>
#I compressed the file with tar, hopefully it didnt ruin any file permissions.
